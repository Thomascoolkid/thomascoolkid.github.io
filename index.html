<center><p style="color:red">THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO WHY ALFRED "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC HAS BEEN UNDERGOING MALE PREGNANCY FOR FAR LONGER THAN A NORMAL HUMAN FEMALE. MALES CAN NOT NATURALLY HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE OF A LACK OF A UTERUS, OR A WOMB. THERE IS SIMPLY NOWHERE A BABY CAN NATURALLY GROW, SO THE FIRST PROCESS IN WEIRD AL'S MALE PREGNANCY IS GROWING A UTERUS, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN HIS BLOATING AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BABY BUMP AS EARLY AS 2015. THEN, THE BABY HAS ROOM TO GROW; BUT WEIRD AL'S LACK OF OVUM, OR EGGS, IS PROBABLY MAKING YOU QUESTION, HOW IN THE WORLD DOES THE BABY ACTUALLY GROW? WELL, ITS NOT ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE, AS PROVEN BY WEIRD AL YANKOVIC HIMSELF. ANOTHER FACTOR OF WHY ITS TAKING SO LONG, IS THAT THE BABY HAS TO GROW AND FORM FROM JUST THE SPERM. WHEN INJECTED WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUID OVUM, A BABY IS ALLOWED TO GROW IN THE MALE BODY - ALBEIT SLOWLY - AS THE TESTOSTERONE IN HIS BODY STUNTS THE BABIES GROWTH, MEANING HE NEEDS TO BE INSIDE HIS BODY LONGER</p><center>
